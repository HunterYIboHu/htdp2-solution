; Exercise 149. Compare the function definitions from this section
; (sum, how-many, all-true, one-true) with
; the corresponding function definitions from the preceding sections.
; Is it better to work with data definitions that accommodate empty lists
; as opposed to definitions for non-empty lists? Why? Why not?
