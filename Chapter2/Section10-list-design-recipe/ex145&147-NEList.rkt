; Exercise 145. Would sum and how-many work for NEList-of-temperatures even 
; if they were designed for inputs from List-of-temperatures?
; If you think they donâ€™t work, provide counter-examples.
; If you think they would, explain why.

; Answer: They would. These functions are designed for any list that
; consists of numbers, no matter what the list is empty or not.

; A CTemperature is a Number greater or equal to -273

; A NEList-of-temperatures is one of:
; - (cons CTemperature '())
; - (cons CTemperature NEList-of-temperatures)
; interpretation non-empty lists of measured temperatures


; NEList-of-temperatures -> Number
; computes the average temperature

(check-expect (average (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 '())))) 2)

(define (average anelot)
  (/ (sum anelot)
     (how-many anelot)))


; NEList-of-temperatures -> Number
; adds up the temperatures on the given list

(check-expect (sum (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 '())))) 6)
(check-expect (sum (cons 30 (cons 2 (cons 1111 (cons 3 '()))))) 1146)
