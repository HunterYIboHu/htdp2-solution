;; Questions
;; Q1: Develop a formula that describes the abstract running time of
;; relative->absolute.
;;
;; A1: Assuming that n is the length of input, add-to-each's abstract
;; running time is n; and every time relative->absolute call it, the
;; length of input will sub1, the length of first input is (- n 1).
;; So, the formula maybe: \sum{n-1}{0}+n=(* 1/2 n n) - (* 1/2 n) + n =
;; (+ (* 1/2 n n) (* 1/2 n)).
;; n is times of relative->absolute calls, (- (* 1/2 n n) (* 1/2 n)) is
;; the times of add-to-each calls.
;; it shoud be O(n^2).
