Exercise 128. Suppose the program contains 
```
(define-struct ball [x y speed-x speed-y])
```
Predict the results of evaluating the following expression: 

1.(number? (make-ball 1 2 3 4))

Answer: #false

2.(ball-speed-y (make-ball (+ 1 2) (+ 3 3) 2 3))

Answer: 3

3.(ball-y (make-ball (+ 1 2) (+ 3 3) 2 3))

Answer: 6 

4.(ball-x (make-posn 1 2))

Answer: Error

5.(ball-speed-y 5)

Answer: Error

Check your predictions in DrRacketâ€™s interactions area. Use the stepper to see how DrRacket produces this result.
